            Hot Rides Automotive Expo is the ultimate destination for car and truck enthusiasts across the country. 
            With events happening nearly every weekend and even on weeknights during the warmer months, 
            owners have the opportunity to showcase their vehicles and compete for trophies. 
            Funds raised from these events are carefully managed and budgeted for future expos, 
            while also being used to support local non-profits and charities. 
            We are committed to giving back to our communities and making a positive impact through our events. 
            Additionally, our expos feature vendors and sponsors who contribute to the vibrant atmosphere, 
            with various sponsorship packages available to promote their brand and support the event.
